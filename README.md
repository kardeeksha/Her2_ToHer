# HER2Her



With increased integration of healthcare and technology, patients and researchers look forward to the implementation of personalized healthcare. HER2Her aims to bring predictive medicine to the hands of women suffering Breast Cancer. Named after one of the most common biological factors present in Breast Cancer, Her2 to Her allows anyone to upload genomic information (sequence data or mutation list). Our program will then sum the effect scores of various breast cancer drugs, and make a recommendation based on clinical efficacy data.



## Uploading Data



Launch the web version of Her2 to Her. Upload either a csv of the patient’s sequences for the five specified genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, and CHEK2). Or, upload csv file with 2 columns: one with the gene name, and the other with “1” for mutated and “0” for normal. 



## Clinical Data



All drug efficacy data is given by (<https://www.cancerrxgene.org/>), who collected, verified, and published cancer drug sensitivity data from dozens of clinical trials and academic research projects. We tested our application with patient data collected from (<https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets>), specifically the May 2016 Nature paper(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27161491>).
